# Ablation: Lp Exponent Sweep

**Phase:** 6 — Ablation Runs

Sweeps p in {1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0} with 2 seeds each to
investigate whether the Lp effect established in pixel space by SLIM-Diff
(Pascual-Gonzalez et al., 2026) transfers to latent space.

See `docs/splits/phase_6.md` for full specification.

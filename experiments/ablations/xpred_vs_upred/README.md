# Ablation: x-Prediction vs. u-Prediction

**Phase:** 6 — Ablation Runs

Compares x-prediction and u-prediction parameterisations with 3 seeds each.
Tests whether VAE pre-compression attenuates the x-prediction advantage
observed in pixel-space by pMF (Lu et al., 2026).

See `docs/splits/phase_6.md` for full specification.

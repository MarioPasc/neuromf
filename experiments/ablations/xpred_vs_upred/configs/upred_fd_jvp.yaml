# u-prediction + FD-JVP (with gradient checkpointing)
#
# Merged on top of: base.yaml -> train_meanflow.yaml -> picasso/train_meanflow.yaml
#
# Inherits from Picasso overlay (intentionally not overridden):
#   use_v_head: true, v_head_num_res_blocks: 1, conditioning_mode: h
#   The v-head provides JVP tangent quality; held constant across ablation arms.
#
# This arm uses the current default config (u-prediction was chosen because
# x-pred + FD-JVP is unstable). FD-JVP allows gradient checkpointing and
# flash attention, enabling larger batch sizes per GPU.
#
# Effective batch = batch_size x devices x accumulate = 16 x 2 x 4 = 128
#
# Note: The Picasso overlay already sets the correct values for this arm.
# This config only overrides the output paths for result isolation.

# Stage 1: Healthy Brain MRI Training

**Phases:** 3–5 — MeanFlow Loss Integration, Training, and Evaluation

Trains the latent MeanFlow model on FOMO-60K pre-computed latents (OASIS-1, OASIS-2, IXI),
generates 1-NFE samples, and evaluates with FID, SSIM, PSNR, and SynthSeg.

See `docs/splits/phase_3.md`, `phase_4.md`, `phase_5.md` for full specification.
